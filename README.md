# curvy

Brute-force vanity onion addresses.

## About

*curvy* is a tool very similar [mkp224o](https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o).
It is currently in a very early stage and does not even offer a public
command line interface, nor a way to export the brute-forced secret key.
This is open space however, so please stay tuned! 🪐

## TODO

* [ ] Offer a command-line interface
* [ ] Store the exported key
* [ ] Rewrite this in a language that natively supports threads
